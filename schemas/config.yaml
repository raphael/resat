# == Synopsis
#
#   This file contains the Kwalify YAML schema for the resat config file
#
#   The resat config file is used to specify the API URI components as
#   well as any required auxiliary information (such as username/password)
#
#   The 'params' and 'headers' collections define request parameters and 
#   headers that will be sent with every API calls by default.
# 
#   The 'variables' collection define global variables and their values.
#   The 'output' field defines the path to the file where extracted
#   variables should be saved if the corresponding 'save' field in the 
#   scenario is true.
#   The 'input' field defines the path to the file where variables are
#   defined that should be loaded prior to executing any scenario.
#   Both the output and input file use YAML to serialize variables so that
#   a file produced as an output of resat can be later used as input.
#
# == Note
#
#  All the URI components defined in the Config file may be overridden by
#  each request in the scenario.
