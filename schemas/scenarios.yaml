# == Synopsis
#   This file contains the Kwalify YAML schema for resat test scenarios.
#   Scenarios consists of API requests and responses validation.
#
#   A scenario may include other scenarios in which case all the included
#   scenarios steps will be executed first even if the included scenario
#   is marked as 'ignore' (that way it becomes possible to define
#   include-only scenarios).
#
#   Each step may define guards, that is conditions that must be validated
#   before the flow can proceed. These conditions may apply to the response
#   header or body and may define a pattern that a given field must validate
#   for the guard to be enabled (and the flow to proceed). If no pattern is
#   specified then all that is required is for the call to be successful. 
#   During execution a guard will re-send the same request until the condition
#   gets fulfilled or it timeouts.
#   
#   API responses bodies and headers can optionally be run through filters.
#   Filters can provide additional validation and can also initialize variables
#   from the response. These variables can the be used in headers and parameters
#   to later API requests as well as patterns used for validation and extraction.
#
#   Variables are initialized via extractors defined in filters. Extractors
#   may use a regular expression with a capturing group. The variable is 
#   initialized with the first capturing group match. If no regular expression
#   is specified then the whole field is stored in the given variable.
#
#   Fields in headers are identified by name while fields in response bodies 
#   are identified by their XPath e.g.:
#
#   deployments/deployment/servers/server/state
#
#   Filters validation is done through regular expressions validators and/or
#   checking whether a field is empty. All validators regular expressions must
#   match for the validation to pass. The validation will be applied to all 
#   elements matching the field XPath in the case of validators applied to a
#   response body.
#
#   To use a variable simply prefix its name with the '$' character e.g.:
#
#   # Filter definition for extracting 'server_id' variable:
#   target: header
#   extractors:
#   - field:    location
#     pattern:  '.*\/servers\/(\d+)$'
#     variable: server_id
#   
#   # API call definition using the 'server_id' variable:
#   operation: show
#   resource:  server
#   id:        $server_id
#
