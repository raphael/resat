# This scenario will launch an All-in-on Rails server, wait for it to become
# operational, run a RightScript (Mongrels restart) and then stop the server,
# wait for it to be stopped and delete it.
#
# Note: This scenario reuses the 'create_server' scenario to create the 
# Rails All-in-one server.
